# SQL - Challenge
## SQL Assignment - Employee Database
***

This assignment is a research project on employees of the Pewlett Hackard corporation from the 1980s and 1990s.  It also seeks to find out if the given dataset is fake.

An entity relationship diagram (ERD) was created as well as a table schema.  Tables were designed to hold data.  Then CSVs were imported into a SQL database for analysis.  


Inside this repository you will find:
* "EmpolyeeSQL" directory
    * "Data" directory - contains six CSV files which is all that remains of the employee database
    * ERD - Employee Database.png
    * schema.sql
    * Analysis.sql
        * Queries    
            1.  List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

            2.  List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.

            3.  List the department number, department name, the manager employee number, last name, first name of each manager of each department.

            4.  List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

            4.  List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

            5.  List all employees in the Sales department with their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

            6.  List all employees in the Sales and Development departments with their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

            7.  In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.


* "Bonus" directory - For the bonus, the SQL database was imported into Pandas using SQLAlchemy.
    * Bonus.ipynb - jupyter notebook file that seeks to validate the data
        * Look for my employee ID per my boss's suggestion
    * SalaryHist - histogram showing the most common salary ranges for employees
    * TitleSalaryBar - bar chart showing average salary by title

Usage:
Using postgres, create a new database.  Open and run schema.sql in the EmployeeSQL directory to create the necessary tables. Import the six CSV files found in the data directory into the corresponding tables.  Open and run Analysis.sql for the queries.  Reference the ERD-Employee Database.png for table details.

Bonus: Open jupyter notebook file Bonus.ipynb.  Before you run the file, you must modify the password to your pgAdmin password and edit the parameters for your username, host, port, and database name.
